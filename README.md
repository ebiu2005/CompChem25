This repository contains the necessary info for a "Getting Started" practical lecture, 
and subsequent handson sessions

A set of slides explains how to remotely connect to a server through SSH by public/private key pairs
and a method to rotate molecular structures .....
The rotate.f program executes rotations ..... but it is an empty file to be filled by students, rotate.in is the
corresponding input file
